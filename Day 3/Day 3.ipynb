    "100 days of machine learning is a tech challenge where the participants spend 100 continuous days studying, learning and coding machine learning concepts. It involves dedicating a certain amount of time each day to engage in ML-related activities, such as reading books, watching tutorials, completing online courses, working on projects, or participating in coding exercises. The goal is to develop a consistent learning habit and make significant progress in ML skills over the course of 100 days."

In Linear Regression, we fit a straight line to a set of points in order to solve for some target variable. This line is called the regression line and it is a set of points which can best represent all the points scattered on the graph.\n",
